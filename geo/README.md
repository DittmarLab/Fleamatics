Reconstruction of biogeography
======

Geographical locations of ancestral lineages were inferred using the Bayesian
Binary MCMC (BBM) method implemented in RASP.

- `geo.tsv`: Geographical distributions of specimens by genus.
- `codes.txt`: Mapping of letter codes to continent names.
- `input.txt`: Mapping of taxa to codes (input for RASP).
- `result.tre`: Tree in NEXUS format with tips and internal nodes labeled with
original or RASP-inferred probabilities of geographical locations.
