Reconstruction of host associations
======

Host associations of ancestral lineages were inferred using the Bayesian Binary MCMC
(BBM) method implemented in RASP.

- `host.tsv`: Host associations by class of specimens by genus.
- `codes.txt`: Mapping of letter codes to host class names.
- `input.txt`: Mapping of taxa to codes (unnormalized) (input for RASP).
- `result.tre`: Tree in NEXUS format with tips and internal nodes labeled with
original or RASP-inferred probabilities of host associations.
